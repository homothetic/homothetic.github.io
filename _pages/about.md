I am currently a PhD student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Si Liu](https://colalab.net/people). I obtained my BSc and MSc degrees from Beihang University in 2022 and 2024, respectively.

I have interned at companies including [Nio](https://www.nio.cn/), [Alibaba](https://www.alibaba.com/), [TuSimple](https://www.tusimple.com/), and [Meituan](https://www.meituan.com/).

My current research focuses on vision and scene understanding, specifically in areas such as 3D scene analysis and video analysis.
