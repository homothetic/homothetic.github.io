I am currently a PhD student at the School of Artificial Intelligence, Beihang University, under the supervision of [Prof. Si Liu](https://colalab.net/).

I received my bachelor's and master's degrees from the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Beihang University in 2022 and 2024, respectively.

My research focuses on vision and scene understanding. 

Feel free to contact me via email.
